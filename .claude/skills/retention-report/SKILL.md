# Own-channel retention report

Details live in `channel-analytics/claude.md`.

## Steps
1. **Token:** if `channel-analytics/token.json` is missing or refresh fails, run `python channel-analytics/oauth_setup.py` in the background and ask the user to approve the browser consent (the one step that needs them).
2. **Run:** `python channel-analytics/retention.py` (newest 25), or `--video ID` for one video, or `--limit 50`. Add `--no-quotes` on big runs to save quota.
3. **Read** `channel-analytics/reports/retention_<date>.md` and summarise for the user: the best and worst hooks, recurring drop-off causes (from the quotes), rewatch moments worth reusing as shorts or thumbnails.
4. **Feed lessons forward:** recurring patterns go into the hook-research docs (`long-form-hook-research/`, `shorts-hook-research/`) so new scripts and edits use them.

## Gotchas (keep this list updated)
- Analytics lag about 2 to 3 days, so fresh uploads show "no data yet".
- **First run 403 `accessNotConfigured`** (2026-10-01): the Cloud project 777575800011 needed the YouTube Analytics API enabled at console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtubeanalytics.googleapis.com/overview?project=777575800011 (Thor profile). It takes a few minutes to propagate after enabling.
- Livestreams and test streams are filtered out on purpose.
